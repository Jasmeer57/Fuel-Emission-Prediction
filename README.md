Data set link - https://bit.ly/co2-emission-dataset


Using scikit-learn library implementation of Simple linear regression. We splitted our data into training and test sets, created a model using training set, Evaluated the model using test set, and finally used the model to predict unknown values. After this, we found the MSE, R2 and Absolute error of the model.
